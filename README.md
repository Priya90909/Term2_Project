📚 ReadStack – Personal Book Tracking Web App

📝 Project Description

ReadStack is a DOM-based web application that helps users manage and track their personal book collection. Users can add books, track reading status, view detailed book information, edit or delete entries, and monitor their reading progress — all directly in the browser using Vanilla JavaScript and LocalStorage.

This project is built as part of the Web Dev II (Batch 2029) Final Project, focusing on JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and frontend application logic without using any frameworks.
